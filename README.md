# MobileDevelopmentGithubStarter

All that you're required to do for this assignment is to edit this README with a bit of information:

* Your name
* Your favorite programming language
* Your favorite text editor

Also, upload a picture of you to the repo (to help me learn your name).

When complete, commit the README back up to github.

We are working on three things with this assignment:
  * I can get you added to the github classroom, which I intend to use throughout the semester
  * You can experience being given an assignment through github classroom
  * I can experience grading an assignment in github classroom
  
Thanks!
